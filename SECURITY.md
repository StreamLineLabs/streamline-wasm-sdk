## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to **security@streamlinelabs.dev**.

**Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Communicated after assessment

We follow responsible disclosure practices and will credit reporters (with permission) in our release notes.

Rust dependencies are checked with RustSec and `cargo-deny` in CI and before
release. Code scanning uses GitHub CodeQL's Rust extractor rather than treating
the Rust source tree as C/C++.

## Security Best Practices
